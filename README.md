## My specific .config files üìë are all up there to find.

## Make sure to install all needed applications and their dependencies before applying any of my .config files.
## For the Rofi launcher and powermenu, you have to bind the launcher.sh and powermenu.sh in the ~/.config/rofi directory to your desired keybinding. KDE doesn't allow scripts for keybinds so i just made two "applications" with Menu Editor and created two entries with commands sh ~/.config/rofi/launcher.sh and the same for powermenu. Those "applications" can then be bound to a key-combination.

## After pasting the sunset.colors in your ~/.local/share/color-schemes folder you have to manually apply it via the colors settings in your system settings.

## I hope i didn't forget anything that you saw in my post...if yes and you want something specific you can just contact me either here or on reddit and i give you what you crave.
